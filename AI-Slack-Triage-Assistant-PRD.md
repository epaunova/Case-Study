## Feature: AI-Powered Slack Assistant for Feedback Triage

### Problem Statement
Product teams often receive scattered user feedback across Slack channels. It's difficult to track issues, categorize feedback, or route requests efficiently, leading to missed insights and slower iteration.

### Solution
Build an LLM-powered Slack bot that listens in feedback or support channels, categorizes messages in real time, and pushes structured summaries to Notion, Jira, or internal tools.

---

## User Stories

- As a product manager, I want to automatically organize Slack feedback by category (bug, feature, UX), so I can prioritize effectively.
- As a support lead, I want high-urgency messages to be escalated instantly.
- As a developer, I want bug reports to be turned into Jira tickets without manual copy/paste.

---

## LLM Capabilities Required

- Message classification (category + urgency)
- Deduplication and clustering (group similar feedback)
- Slack formatting (emoji, tags)
- API call generation (Jira, Notion)
- Context retention across threads

---

## Prompt Example

**System Prompt:**  
"You are a support triage assistant. Classify Slack messages and decide if action is needed."

**Slack Message:**  
"When I try to log in, the page just spins forever. Urgent — can't use the platform at all."

**Bot Output:**  
```
Category: Bug  
Urgency: High  
Action: Create Jira ticket in 'Login Issues' backlog
```

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- 🎯 Classification accuracy (on labeled Slack messages)
- ⏱ Time from feedback → ticket/action
- 📊 % of actionable feedback routed to correct team
- 🔄 Manual review match rate (e.g., PM validates bot actions)

---

## Rollout Plan

- Phase 1: Passive mode — bot labels but takes no action
- Phase 2: Notifications — bot pings PMs with summaries
- Phase 3: Active routing — bot files tickets or updates tools automatically

---

## Mock UX Flow (Slack)
```
User posts: “Settings page throws 500 error when I save.”
Bot replies:  
👀 Detected: Bug  
🧩 Urgency: Medium  
✅ Suggested action: Open Jira ticket? [Yes] [No]
```

---

## Integration Targets
- Slack Events API
- Jira API / Notion API
- Internal triage dashboards

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- ❗ Misclassification → Manual override UI
- ❗ User privacy → Limit to #feedback, #support channels only
